Throughout the process of building this library, we had useful conversations with several stakeholders and researchers in this domain. We are extremely grateful for all the guidance we received through these conversations. 

We thank Alina Hu, Peter Yoachim, Jeremy Tregloan-Reed and Christian Adams for their assistance in understanding the topic of satellite streaks better and gaining information about the current work being carried out on this topic. 

We thank Aparna Venkatesan, University of San Francisco and Juan-Carlos Chavez for sharing their knowledge on how satellite streaks impact Indigenous communities. 

Last but not least, we are incredibly grateful to Vaughn Iverson, Meredith Rawls and Dino Bektesevic from eScience Institute, University of Washington for patiently guiding us throughout this entire 10 weeks and helping us create a product that we can look back at with some humble admiration.
